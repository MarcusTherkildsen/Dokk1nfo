# Dokk1nfo
Source code for the [dokk1nfo.dk](http://www.dokk1nfo.dk) website

This website was created out of my own frustation of not being able to find items at the largest public library in Scandinavia, [dokk1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokk1#Library_and_culture_center).

Dokk1nfo.dk solves this problem by generating a map for the user, indicating the exact shelve(s) the item is positioned on.

Simply search for an item

and then click on the one you want

TODO:
- Add pages
  - Parking
  - Solar power
  - Number of people in line
  - Number of people currently inside Dokk1

DONE:
- Generate proper toilet and printer maps
- Look into where stuff goes wrong with the new system. Use "turen g√•r til" as a test case since that does not work anymore. Workaround added.
- Move scraping to serverside.
- Get current dokk1nfo code on github.
